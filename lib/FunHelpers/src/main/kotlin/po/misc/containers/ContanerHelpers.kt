/**
 * Executes the given [block] with [receiver] as the lambda receiver.
 * Enables DSL-like scoping to expose the [receiver]'s functions and properties directly.
 * Useful when working with nested containers or delegating context behavior.
 *
 * Example use case:
 * ```kotlin
 * someContainer.withReceiver {
 *     // 'this' refers to the receiver, not the container
 *     hello()
 * }
 * ```
 * @receiver A [ReceiverContainer] whose [receiver] will be passed as lambda receiver.
 * @param block The lambda to execute in the [receiver]'s scope.

 * @param block The lambda to execute with the [receiver] as receiver.
