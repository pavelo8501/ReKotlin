/**
 * Marker interface for components capable of owning a [DSLContainer].
 *
 * Implementing this interface allows a class to participate in DSL construction
 * by exposing a [dslContainer]. It also enables the use of the [dslBuilder] extension
 * function, which simplifies the process of building and resolving nested DSL blocks.
 *
 * This is typically used as a hook to embed DSL logic declaratively inside a
 * larger structure or coordinator.
 *
 * @param T The input data type the DSL operates on.
 * @param R The result type produced by DSL blocks.
 *
 * @see dslBuilder
