/**
 * Defines a contract for components that participate in DSL block execution and composition.
 *
 * This interface represents a composable DSL structure that can accumulate processing blocks
 * (`next`) and support nested DSL sub-containers (`with`). It is intended to abstract reusable
 * execution logic in a tree-like DSL builder system.
 *
 * Typical usage includes collecting logic steps (`DSLProvider`s), organizing them into containers,
 * and executing them against a source input type [T], yielding results of type [R].
 *
 * @param T The input type that DSL blocks operate on.
 * @param R The result type produced by each DSL block.
