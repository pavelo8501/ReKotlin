# Exposify

**Exposify** is a Kotlin library built on top of JetBrains' [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) SQL framework. It provides an abstraction layer over Exposed DAO and DSL to simplify and streamline the creation of DTO-based, coroutine-friendly data access logic.

## Features

- üß© Automatic mapping between entities and DTOs
- üîÑ Seamless one-to-many, one-to-one relationship bindings
- üßµ Coroutine-compatible transactions and logging
- üîç Custom query conditions via DSL-like syntax
- üõ†Ô∏è Extensible repositories with pluggable update/select logic

## Getting Started

[//]: # (To include Exposify in your project, add the following dependency &#40;once published&#41;:)

[//]: # (```kotlin)

[//]: # (dependencies {)

[//]: # (    implementation&#40;"com.yourdomain:exposify:<version>"&#41;)

[//]: # (})

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # (> üìå Note: This library uses JetBrains' Exposed under the hood. You do **not** need to add Exposed manually if it's included via `api&#40;&#41;` or `implementation&#40;&#41;` in Exposify.)
